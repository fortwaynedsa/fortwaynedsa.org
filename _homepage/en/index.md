## What is the DSA?

As the largest socialist organization in the nation, we are a movement— not a political party — that works against oppression in its many forms. We see these multiple forces — economic inequality, patriarchy, white supremacy, and others — as interlinked, intersecting and inseparable.

DSA’s members are building mass movements for social change in their respective cities. We are united in creating a more equitable world by establishing socialism as a political force. We believe our governments and economy should operate, through social ownership, for the benefit of all.

Locally, we represent Huntington, Steuben, Wells, and Whitley counties and advocate for causes that impact our region and beyond. Our tagline is “Three Rivers, One Struggle,” and it’s a nod to the St. Mary’s, St. Joseph, and Maumee rivers that have been an intrinsic part of the city’s heritage. Like the rivers that come together to form a confluence, so do our members to promote freedom, equality, justice, and solidarity for the many, not the few.

Solidarity!
