The DSA's national convention is happening August 1st through the 8th, and in our general meetings leading up to that, we'll be reading through some of the resolutions that our delegate and alternate (Lauren and Ryan, respectively) will be voting on there. [A list of the convention resolutions can be seen here](https://convention2021.dsausa.org/2021-dsa-convention-resolutions/) - these set the priorities of the organization as a whole, so if you see anything you'd like Fort Wayne DSA to make a priority, please bring it up during a meeting!
