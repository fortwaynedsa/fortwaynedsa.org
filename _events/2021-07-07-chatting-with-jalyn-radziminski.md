Born and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Jalyn Radziminski is passionate about uniting education, non-profits, government, and grassroots community initiatives to promote equity both socially and systematically. Jalyn saw the need to encourage more diverse voter turnout and political participation in Indiana. Thus, Jalyn founded Count US IN to uplift voices in Indiana locally as well highlight Indiana's relevance in the national political conversations.

Jalyn graduated from Emory University with a bachelors in linguistics and interdisciplinary studies with a human rights concentration. Much of Radziminski's work is dedicated to advocating for voter rights, youth empowerment, mental health for people of color, ending mass incarceration, and accessibility for people who live with disabilities as well as building domestic and international coalitions.

When there is free time, Jalyn enjoys traveling, dancing, gardening, and, as an avid animal lover, pet-sitting or volunteering at animal shelters.
