**Fort Wayne DSA needs you!** Our steering committee has laid the foundation, and we need people to take our chapter to the next level. Fill out the form below to indicate your interest in one of the positions on our executive committee (the group of people that helps organize the chapter)!

No experience is required.  Anyone can run for any position. These are the people wanting to come back but you can still be interested in any position.  New people are needed as some are not able to give as much time as required. Please reach out to dsafortwayne@gmail.com or on our Slack if you are interested in running for a position! We will keep the ballots open until the end of October. Then voting will commence at the November meeting.
