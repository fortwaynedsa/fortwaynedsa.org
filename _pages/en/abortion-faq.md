# Where to get an abortion?

Fort Wayne does not offer access to abortions in town; you must travel to a different clinic in a neighboring city. This is because of [claimed harassment](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/07/09/ppink-head-blames-closure-fort-wayne-clinic-right-lifers/769213002/) by right-wing "Right to Life" protestors harassing the staff and patients.

# Why is it so difficult to get an abortion?
Abortion after 22 weeks since last menstrual period is banned in Indiana unless the procedure is necessary to preserve the pregnant person's physical health.

Patients must receive counseling in person and then wait 18-hours before getting an abortion.

The parent of a minor must consent before an abortion is provided.

There is an ultrasound requirement in this state. The abortion provider must offer the patient the option of looking at the image.

Abortion is legal in the United States. However, each state has varying regulations.
