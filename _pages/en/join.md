## Why join the DSA?

We believe tomorrow’s change starts today.  We’re here to challenge the status quo — and we’re here to win. We need to organize mass, democratic people power – for ourselves and for each other.

We are working to effect massive social change while establishing an openly socialist presence in American communities and politics. Joining DSA means making a commitment to cooperation and solidarity — and it all starts at the local level.

## Ready to do the work?

Fort Wayne DSA is a chapter of the national DSA organization, and joining one means joining the other! If you're able to pay dues, there a variety of options available, but **we suggest selecting a monthly option**, as this allows our chapter to recieve a portion of the amount collected.
