title: Fort Wayne DSA Hosts Period Product Drive
description: Public invited to help fight “period poverty” in Fort Wayne
---

A 2021 survey revealed that nearly a quarter of teenage students in the U.S. 
experienced period poverty — the inability to access menstrual hygiene products. 
Furthermore, half of the students surveyed have worn products longer than 
recommended.

It’s difficult to quantify the precise impact locally but given the poverty rate in Fort 
Wayne Community Schools, the need is likely substantial. That’s why the Fort Wayne 
chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is taking action. To that end, the 
organization is collecting UNOPENED hygiene products including pads, tampons, 
liners, and more to benefit FWCS students now through **January 31st**.

“The Fort Wayne DSA is very excited to be starting our period product drive,” says 
Christopher Thurber, Fort Wayne DSA co-chair. “The need for menstrual products 
during this stage of life is apparent. At least half of the teenage population menstruates, 
and we want to partner with individuals and organizations to collect products to help 
relieve stress and anxiety around a natural bodily function. FW DSA hopes to offer relief
to people who are struggling with period poverty and shine a light on this issue in our 
community. We hope that this is just the beginning on tackling this community issue 
once and for all.”
